# Simple-Chatty-Bot
Jetbrains first project

This is a small app that asks for the users name, then guesses his age based on some operations and remainders. After that the app makes a question and runs a function that repeats until the user gets the correct answer 

In this app I applied the use of simple inout and outputs, if statements and for loops, and finally the use of a simple function.
